### User Type A (Book Lender/Seller):

As a book lender/seller, I want to keep track of all books that I finished reading and wanted to lend in the platform, so that I will not mix up with other books I haven't read.

As a book lender/seller, I want to send a post about a book that I want to lend, so that other people can see the books that I want to lend.

As a book lender/seller, I want to add more infomation about the book in the post, so that other people can look into the post to see if the book is what they are looking for.

As a book lender/seller, I want to delete posts, so that I know the book that the post shows has been lent and I will not mix them up with books I haven't lent.

As a book lender/seller, I want to be able to add an attribute to a post about whether I'm selling or lending this book, so that other people can know my intention clearly.

### User Type B (Book Borrower/Buyer)

As a book borrower/buyer, I want to see how many people want to borrow the book in a post, so that I can estimate my chance of getting this book and act accordingly.

As a book borrower/buyer, I want to see all the posts that have books I like in a hub, so that I can have a clear view of all the books I want to borrow/buy.

As a book borrower/buyer, I want to delete/unlike posts in a hub after I do not want the book anymore or I have already got the book, so that the hub only shows books I don't have clearly.

As a book borrower/buyer, I want to have a search bar to look for books I want, so that I can find books more efficiently.

As a book borrower/buyer, I want to see the contact information of the person who sent the post, so that I can get talk with them about the book I want.
